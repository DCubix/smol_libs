# smol_libs

My attempt of making single header C-libraries for maximum portability. 

So far I've only made [smol_frame.h](https://github.com/MaGetzUb/smol_libs/blob/master/smol_frame.h) for creating simple windows for graphics programming. In the sample code I use [TSoding](https://github.com/tsoding/)'s [olive.c](https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c).
